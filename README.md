3d printer

in working from long long time
###############################

Initially started in China diuring my artistic residency but never the times for finish...
and now 3D printers are very cheap and strong.
Well just push for fun and for constrain me to finish just all parts...

The start idea it was to design a 3D printer like a umbrella.
Folding a delta/rostock like form the middle and push a key between axes for constrain the structure.
